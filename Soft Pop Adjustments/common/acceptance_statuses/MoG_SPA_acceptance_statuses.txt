## Important Note:
## Near as I can tell, Migration Desire is simply:
# FORMULA: MD = base_migration_desire + (job_satisfaction * MIGRATION_DESIRE_FROM_JOB_SATISFACTION_FACTOR)
#
# The objective is that people jobseek a decent amount *before* electing to migrate.
# Ideally job satisfaction doesn't fluctuate by large amounts under "normal" conditions.

# SPA update note: make sure the thresholds are alligned with common/script_values/yMoG_SPA_event_values_overwrites.txt
