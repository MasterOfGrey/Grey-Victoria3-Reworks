This mod is a large overhaul for interacting with your subjects.
It contains a [i]complete overhaul[/i] of Liberty Desire, and a range of additional subject interactions either created by myself, sourced from abandoned mods and updated, or included with permission.

[h1]Features:[/h1]
[h2]Liberty Desire Overhaul:[/h2]
[list]
[*]BASE Liberty Desire has been totally removed and replaced with [b]Legal Friction[/b].
[*]Legal Friction applies liberty desire to subjects based on differences between their laws and yours that relate to; how governments interact with each other, and wealth-owner groups investment options and returns.
[*]The impact of Overlord Prestige on reducing liberty desire now scales through 5 tiers. 
[*]The power of the overlord's army (up to a max of 10x) reduces subject liberty desire... and the inverse is true also...
[*][b]Overseas[/b] subjects will now receive less liberty desire reduction from the overlord's army, if they have a powerful fleet to stop you from landing.
[*]...and having a powerful fleet will add liberty desire all of its own...
[/list]

[h2]Additional Subject Interactions:[/h2]
[list]
[*]Ask Your Subject to Fight - updated and expanded, triggers your subject to declare to conquer a state of your choosing. (Can also Return State with claims, take existing Treaty Ports, or Annex a nation if it's your subject's direct subject, or has at most 3 states.)
[*]Initiate Open Borders - gradually encourages them to change law to Open Borders.
[*]Integrate Subject - allows for diplomatic integration of sufficiently friendly and low-liberty desire subjects.
[*]Initiate Cultural Alignment - updated and refined localisation, diplomatic agreement to eventually align their primary culture with yours.
[*]Initiate Religious Conversion - separate diplomatic agreement to eventually align their state religion with yours.
[*]Initiate Cultural Inclusion - works to eventually your primary culture to their country in addition to their own.
[*]Synergize Bureaucracy/Economic Systems/Land Reforms/Trade Policies - gradually (and forcibly) align a subject's Bureaucracy/Economic Systems/Land Reforms/Trade Policies laws to match yours.
[*]Forced Industry Ban - forcibly change a subject's law to Industry Banned, at substantial diplomatic cost...
[*]Forced Border Closing/Opening - force a subject to close/open its borders, closing requires clos relations and is not a huge matter... opening is a more freely usable but much less popular decision.
[*]Consolidate Subjects - Merge subjects of similar cultures together (does not count cultures added by you). [i]Many thanks to [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/CaelReader/myworkshopfiles/?appid=529340]CaelReader[/url]![/i]
[*]Support Subject Expansion - causes subjects to adopt an aggressive strategy towards regional neighbours.
[*]Forced Slavery Ban - forcibly change a subject's law to Slavery Banned, may upset some people...
[*]Forced Slave Trade - forcibly change a subject's law to Slave Trade, will upset [b]a lot[/b] of people...
[*]Recognize - Recognise an unrecognized subject.
[*]Offer Convoy Contribution - As subject, give excess convoys to overlord
[/list]

NOTE: These appear contextually - they won't show for a particular subject if they're not potentially valid.

[h2]Game Rules:[/h2]
- Set whether the AI can use the Merge Subject action (Default = yes)
--> Choose whether the Merge Subject action is balanced, cheaty, or disabled! (Default = balanced)
- Consolidate Subject can be enabled, player only, or disabled
- Synergize actions can be disabled
- Force Law actions can be disabled or limited to slavery laws only
- Culture & Religion Change actions can be disabled

[h2]Bonus features:[/h2]
- When you request a subject change their laws they get a buff to enactment success.
- Trade State, Fund Lobby, Raise/Decrease Payments, Appoint Gov., Support Regime, Evangelize, Demand State, & Support Independence have all been tweaked to improve gameplay.

I expect to add more things to this over time.

This should never conflict with anything unless that thing also changes Liberty Desire.
IF YOU WANT TO MAKE OTHER LIBERTY DESIRE CHANGES COMPATIBLE WITH THIS:
Refer to the instructions in MoG_10_mod_compatibility.txt in \common\script_values

This mod's version of Consolidate Subjects is slightly different to Cael's original mod - [i]if you have both loaded the other will take priority.[/i]

If you find it doesn't behave as advertised; LOAD THIS LAST and try again before reporting issues.

Apparently this works really well with:
