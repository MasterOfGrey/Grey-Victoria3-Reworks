### Innovation modifiers?
## These don't actually *work* - but they can be used to make nice tooltips/descriptions to better explain things to the player (as the modifiers will be hard to parse).

country_weekly_innovation_max_mult={	# Check if it actually doesn't work
	decimals=0
	color=good
	percent=yes
	game_data={
		ai_value=0
	}
}
