# The AI gets itself into trouble using Monopoly Charters quite a lot. So the goal of this is essentially to say, "no, don't give monopoly, but if a country that is higher rank than you has investment rights and the same type of company, then you can use a monopoly defensively".
# This file is named the same in all mods that it appears in so that it doesn't double up on itself between mods.
