###Pollution Changes:
## Total Pollution penalty = 120%, reducible to -90% or -75% by max healthcare
## - >100% max intentional because the goal is to get to over -60% with no healthcare even with all modifiers from other sources combined.
## - This is to counteract the runaway attraction which can come from extra large urban centres when players/AI centralise too many company HQ's in one state.
