This mod is a complete overhaul of the Food Industries building, with the goals of having sensible and dynamic production options that are profitable, while also being maximally compatible with other mods.

Among other things, the distillery options are actually profitable most of the time - but you can benefit from alternative production methods in their place.

This should be compatible with almost anything other than major alternative food reworks. It is dynamic enough to work with alternative pop needs mods.
It is compatible with VTM etc.
