This mod adjusts a number of starting conditions in ways that are still plausible interpretations of the historical state, to better enable some nations to perform successfully.

This is a pretty safe mod.
It will conflict slightly with anything changing [i]these country's[/i] history files, but it [u]should be harmless.[/u]

[b]Why?[/b]
[i]Agricultural reform was a big deal often overlooked in the study of this period. The new ownership mechanics make poor representation of the state at the time into a very impactful issue for some nations.[/i]
