This is a pretty safe mod.
It will conflict slightly with anything changing [i]these country's[/i] history files, but it [u]should be harmless.[/u]
Any overwrites of state features etc. is set to be just barely after vanilla file loading, so other mods will overwrite it easily and safely.

[b]Why?[/b]
[i]Agricultural reform was a big deal often overlooked in the study of this period. The new ownership mechanics make poor representation of the state at the time into a very impactful issue for some nations.[/i]
