This is a compatibility patch for Locomotion: Land, Water, & Air and Urban Synergy Unleashed.

It is [i][u][b]also[/b][/u][/i] the USU + LLWA + Morgenrote compatch (requires USU + Morgenrote [i]and[/i] LLWA + Morgenrote as well).

[h3]Requires the originals: [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3371689443]Urban Synergy Unleashed[/url] and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3032533792]Locomotion: Land, Water, & Air[/url].[/h3]

Load order doesn't matter.

I recommend [i]not[/i] using LLWA's alternative MAPI rules with this - though it's probably fine as long as LLWA is up-to-date when you do.
