This is a fix for an issue that bothers me but may not bother you.

Right now company-owned buildings don't downsize, and there's absolutely no fix for it until Paradox fixes it because it's an engine problem.

The main issue with this is that you end up with massive ownership buildings owning hundreds of empty levels of normal buildings, and this leads to such ridiculous outcomes as some company HQ employing 40k people to manage 17k people working in 800 levels of factories that won't downsize.

For people who play into the late game, this is a seriously destructive problem.

So in the interim, this simply turns off all companies by giving everyone a -1000 company limit and disbanding all existing companies at game start.

This is a sledgehammer fix to provide some respite from this issue.

Load order shouldn't matter.
